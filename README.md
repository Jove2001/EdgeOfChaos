<p>
The universe is, fundementally, an uncertain and chaotic place. Some people may think of Chaos as a
state of disorder, but it is actually
the science of surprises, of the nonlinear and the unpredictable.</p>
<p>
Fractal patterns, which are an
expression of this underlying chaotic principle, are
self-similar patterns that contain infinite variation. They appear in nature in ways such as
the arrangement of flower petals, and the spiral arms of galaxies. Fractal
patterns also emerge in the creative arts. For example, genres in art and music are a way of
grouping self-similar, yet unique works.
</p>
<p>In theory, there should be infinite chaotic potential for unique music
experiences. Until the development of sheet
music, all music was transmitted aurally and
performers drew on their intuition to create unique (or chaotic) music experiences for
their audiences. All music was public art, and performers were free to improvise and add their own
interpretation to the melody or lyrics.
Yet today, most music is privately owned and controlled by a few corporations.

I <a

target="_blank">researched peoples listening habits</a>, and I discovered that many people are
choosing to listen to chaotic sounds such as white noise or ocean sounds instead of music. This made me
wonder if some people were dissatisfied with the current trend of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JZgPKGVJrdc" target="_blank">impossibly-perfect</a> music
production, and <a href="https://www.insidehook.com/music/definitive-version-music" target="_blank">definitive recordings</a> of songs. Perhaps people would appreciate music that is
more chaotic in nature?
</p>
<p>Edge of Chaos is a series of three works where I experimented with chaotic sounds and fractal
patterns in music production. This project is a contribution to public art. It aims to spark a
discussion about music as a public art form, and uniqueness in music performance and production. It is

and add to the chaos.

<p>
The tracks are
inspired by the EDM, lo-fi, and video game music genres.
